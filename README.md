# Advent of Code 2024 - C++ Solutions

Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code 2024**! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

## About
Advent of Code is an annual event featuring a series of programming puzzles that are released daily from December 1st to December 25th. These puzzles are an amazing way to:

- Practice problem-solving skills
- Explore algorithms and data structures
- Hone programming skills in a chosen language

This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 edition, implemented in **C++**.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by days, with each day's puzzle solutions in its own directory:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Day01
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ inputs.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part1.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ part2.cpp
...
```

- **`inputs.txt`**: Contains the input data for the day's puzzle.
- **`part1.cpp`**: Contains the C++ solution for the first puzzle.
- **`part2.cpp`**: Contains the C++ solution for the second puzzle.

## How to Run
To compile and run a solution, navigate to the respective dayâ€™s directory and use a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`):

```bash
cd day1
g++ partx.cpp -o partx
./partx
```

## Progress
| Day  | Puzzle 1 | Puzzle 2 |
|------|----------|----------|
|Day 1 | âœ…       | âœ…       |
|Day 2 | ðŸ”„       | ðŸ”„       |
