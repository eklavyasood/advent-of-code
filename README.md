# Advent of Code - Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions for the **Advent of Code** challenges, organized by year. Each branch corresponds to a specific year of the event, with solutions implemented in different programming languages based on my goals for that year.

## Current Year: 2024

The current branch, **2024**, features solutions written in **C++**. Check out the branch for:

- Code implementations for daily challenges.
- Input files used for testing.
